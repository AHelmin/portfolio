# Portfolio

## Description

This project was created in order to create a portfolio website where potential employers will be able to look at my coding projects. This website will showcase my completed projects.

The website itself has a short about me section, a work section, and a contact section. Each of these items is but a brief overview, but it will allow readers to get a glimpse of me and of what work I have done in the past.

## Installation

Installation is not required. The webpage is accessible from any web browser application.

## Usage
